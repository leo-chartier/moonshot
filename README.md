# Moonshot Project

This repository will hold all the documents relating to my End-of-Degree project.

This so-called "Moonshot project" is part of the graduating criteria at [ALGOSUP](https://algosup.com/en.html), the school where I study.

## The project

"renpath" is a tool designed for the developers and players of Visual Novel games. Visual Novels are interactive books where players make choices that influence the story.

For this first version, renpath aims to list the choices that have to be made to reach a given point in the game. More features will be added in the future to expand its funcitonality such as error detection.

The code for this project is available in its separate repository [here](https://github.com/leo-chartier/renpath).

## Change of heart

This project was not the one I initially started with. I was at first supposed to create software to analyze the different instruments composing a piece of music. For reasons described in the project report, this project was discarded.

The files can be found [here](https://github.com/leo-chartier/Moonshot-old).
